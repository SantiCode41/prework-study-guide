# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is a simple webpage that I will use to keep track of my notes as I complete the boot camp. My motivation in bulding this project was that I wanted to keep my notes organized in one please, while at the same time learning new development tools. By having all my notes in one place that is accecible via any browser, I solved the issue of having to deal with fliping through many pages of physical notes ooking for something I knew I had writen down but could not remember the details of. While putting this project together I learned a lot about how different programing languages can be used in the same project, as well as how git and github can be used to help keep your project organized.
